							<p>Create a comprehensive risk assessment and report, recommending which solution the company should select.<p>
<li>Select a risk assessment methodology to help with your analysis (the course discusses Open FAIR, CMU Octave, and the NIST framework, although others, including hybrids, exist as well). Justify your selection of framework with help from supporting literature – why does it suit this analysis?</li>
<li>Perform an analysis of the risks identified in part one of the assessment.</li>
<li>Produce a table listing the risks, weightings, and overall risk scores and whether you recommend they are avoided, retained, shared, reduced, or transferred.</li>
<p>Create a Disaster Recovery solution for whichever option you recommend. This solution should include:</p>
<o1>
<li>For the RPO/ RTO requirements you have decided to use, you should explain how you came to this decision, and the implications for the company. How does their risk appetite align with this decision?</li>
<li>Your solution should include a high-level diagram that represents the approach you have selected. This should be at the level of function block representation – there is no need to discuss the number or type of servers, etc required.</li>
<li>How does your solution address the challenges of resilience, network security, and vendor provision/ lock-in (if appropriate)?</li>
