							<p>Acme Manufacturing is an SME (Small/Medium Enterprise) employing 150 staff. It produces sporks for niche industries and due to increased demand, has decided to purchase an ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) system to allow itself to more flexibly manage its supply chain. With this, the company should be able to scale production up or down to better meet demand.</p>
              <p>The company has shortlisted its selection down to 3 options:</p>
                   <li>A COTS (Commercial Off the Shelf) solution provided by a major manufacturer at a purchase cost of $100k. Support costs vary depending on the level required but a basic telephone support-only contract starts at $50k p.a.</li>
                   <li>An Open-Source solution that will be installed and supported by their internal IT department, relying on community (forum) support for any escalations.</li>  
                   <li>An in-house created solution built by a student as part of her final year project and supported by the developer, as well as the internal IT department.</li>  
              <p>Currently, all the resource planning and scheduling are done via spreadsheets and that solution is becoming unwieldy.
                  Your team has been retained as IT Risk Consultants with a brief to:</p>
                <li>Create a comprehensive risk assessment and report, recommending which of the three solutions the company should select. You are expected to justify your selection with supporting evidence. </li> 
                <li>Create a Disaster Recovery solution for whichever option you recommend. The company has asked for a Recovery Point Objective of 15 minutes and a Recovery Time Objective of 4 hours. However, their production facility only runs 8 am to 6 pm so the company has asked for your professional recommendations as risk consultants. </li>
