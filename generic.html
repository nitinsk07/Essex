							<h1 class="major">Brief Intro</h1>
							<p>Seasoned cybersecurity professional & international speaker with 17 years of extensive experience in the areas of cybersecurity management and operations with in-depth knowledge on technology and business domains and 13 years of which has been in Aviation cybersecurity.</p>
							<h2 class="major"><u>Work History</u>/h2>
							<p>I am passionate about Cyber Security. Early in my career, I joined Dubai Immigration as a Network and Security Engineer and soon moved into cybersecurity operations handling security products like firewalls, Intrusion Prevention Systems, endpoint security, to name a few. My move to Dubai Airports as an IT Security Engineer was exciting as my team initiated and set up the cybersecurity practice in Dubai Airports. My promotion to Senior Cyber Security Analyst at Dubai Airports came with responsibility for vulnerability management, risk assessment, server security, end-user awareness, data security, and compliance management. 
In 2016, Dubai Airports decided to move into the cloud, and I oversaw implementation of cloud security. We also began aligning our IT department with the Operational Technology/Industrial Control Systems (ICS). Here I was accountable for evaluating the security posture of ICS environments and elevating them into the current standards we follow. I am also responsible for cybersecurity incident management. I eagerly look forward to my workday as there are new challenges every day. As an amateur photographer, I am always looking for “creative” solutions to the Cyber Security problems we face every day.
