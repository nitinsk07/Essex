							<p> The five most efficient cyber defenders are: Anticipation, Education, Detection, Reaction and Resilience. Do remember: "Cybersecurity is much more than an IT topic â€“ Stephane Nappo
							Cyber Security of Critical Infrastructure is of utmost importance. The consequence of a cyber-attack is often service disruption, environmental damage, financial loss, and personal injury on a large scale. Such was the case with the ransomware attack on Norsk Hydro, one of the world's largest aluminium companies, in Norway. Production halted on around 170 plants, and other facilities had to move to manual operations. 
							The ransomware that disabled the global giant was LockerGoga, which, unlike Wannacry or Petya, could not propagate; instead, it took over the IT infrastructure by initially compromising an employee's PC and then capturing the administrative credentials. They deployed the ransomware via a manual push from Norsk Hydro's domain controllers. 
							This is an example of Advanced Persistent Threat (APT). These attacks are not random; the attackers carefully research and target victims. There are warning signs of an APT:
							1.	Targeted Spear Phishing Emails
							2.	Odd logins
							3.	Widespread backdoor trojans
							4.	Data exfiltration
							There needs to be a paradigm shift in the view of Cybersecurity for Critical Infrastructure. Cyber Security and Cyber Risk have to be at the top of the strategic agenda of any company. Detection, which includes having a dedicated DevSecOps team where security starts from day one, is one of the most essential aspects of Cyber Security. 
							Cyber Security needs to be baked-in and not bolted on; designing a product or service and then safeguarding it from the outside should be a thing of the past.
