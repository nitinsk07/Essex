							<i>The five most efficient cyber defenders are: Anticipation, Education, Detection, Reaction and Resilience. Do remember: "Cybersecurity is much more than an IT topic – Stephane Nappo</i>
							<p>Cyber Security of Critical Infrastructure is of utmost importance. The consequence of a cyber-attack is often service disruption, environmental damage, financial loss, and personal injury on a large scale. Such was the case with the ransomware attack on Norsk Hydro, one of the world's largest aluminium companies, in Norway. Production halted on around 170 plants, and other facilities had to move to manual operations.</p>
							<p>The ransomware that disabled the global giant was LockerGoga, which, unlike Wannacry or Petya, could not propagate; instead, it took over the IT infrastructure by initially compromising an employee's PC and then capturing the administrative credentials. They deployed the ransomware via a manual push from Norsk Hydro's domain controllers.</p>
							<p>This is an example of Advanced Persistent Threat (APT). These attacks are not random; the attackers carefully research and target victims. There are warning signs of an APT:</p>
							1.	Targeted Spear Phishing Emails<br>
							2.	Odd logins<br>
							3.	Widespread backdoor trojans<br>
							4.	Data exfiltration<br>
							<p></p>
							<p>There needs to be a paradigm shift in the view of Cybersecurity for Critical Infrastructure. Cyber Security and Cyber Risk have to be at the top of the strategic agenda of any company. Detection, which includes having a dedicated DevSecOps team where security starts from day one, is one of the most essential aspects of Cyber Security.</p>
							<p>Cyber Security needs to be baked-in and not bolted on; designing a product or service and then safeguarding it from the outside should be a thing of the past. </p>

							<h3> My summary</h3><
							<p>
							Cyberthreats on Critical National Infrastructure (CNI) were once thought to be only the domain of nation-states. Only states, experts believed, possessed the broad talents and resources needed to generate such threats. The assets targeted were usually analog and were not connected to the internet. Gaining and maintaining access required specialized tools, specialized tools, similar operational technology, reconnaissance capabilities, and in some cases, physical access to the site itself. 
							<p>Business needs for remote visibility into industrial operations, on the other hand, have contributed to the convergence of IT and OT systems in recent years. The digital transformations that permitted desired corporate benefits like remote access and predictive maintenance also brought new cyberattack vulnerabilities. Infrastructure assets could now be preyed upon by less sophisticated attackers.</p>
							<p>Danialou (2021) mentioned that while CNIs follow the Purdue Enterprise Reference Architecture (PERA), it is insufficient. SANS provides a solution by adding necessary cyber security controls in each layer of PERA and by adopting a rigorous risk assessment approach.</p>
							<p>Cyber resiliency is equally vital as cyber security, as pointed out by Cook (2021). Although it is challenging, having a strategy to protect critical processes that underpin CNI is paramount. This starts by understanding the regulations and global standards for CNI and filling the control gaps. Universally adopted standard ISA/IEC62443 helps reduce the risk of cyber-attacks in ICS environments. Similarly, creating an incident response (IR) plan that incorporates granular threat-driven playbooks to assess better, detect, and control threats; enlisting third parties as needed; and recovering from cybersecurity attacks with minimal disruption to operations is paramount.</p>
							<p>Adopting a security-by-design approach to disruptive technologies including IoT, smart meters, AI and analytics enable CNI to improve performance while reducing costs and increasing efficiencies. Companies can limit the dangers that disruptive technologies may bring into the operating environment by using a security-first approach that incorporates cybersecurity resiliency into the design and architecture of all new system implementations, then thoroughly testing it before going live.</p>

							<h3> My Post</h3>
							<p>
							<p>In 2020, the pandemic forced businesses to transform the way they operate. One of the significant changes was working from home and allowing remote access. As a result of this distributed work environment, new security threats came into existence. Employees who work from home are at a significantly higher risk than those in offices. Because home connections are less secure, cybercriminals can access a company's network more easily.</p>
							<p>Gartner predicted that by 2023, 60% of the enterprise would phase out VPN and use Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA). As enterprises adopt more cloud technologies and work from home must be accounted for, the network perimeter of the enterprise is changing. Traditional VPN is not the right tool for the job. ZTNA is a new technique for safeguarding access to cloud and on-premises applications and services. It works on the principle of Zero Trust – Deny all access unless specifically allowed. It is also a software-defined perimeter (SDP). Traditionally, once a user gains access to the network, they would typically gain access to everything on the network. However, ZTNA flips everything, and the user must be allowed explicit access to network resources down to the application level. This methodology enables more robust overall network security and micro-segmentation, which can help minimize lateral movement in the case of a compromise.</p>
							<p>While ZTNA offers SAAS-like security and access, we also need to account for all cloud-related activities and have a central platform with unified policies, visualization, and threat prevention. CASB offers these capabilities and more in both integrated and standalone form. The CASB acts as a policy enforcement center, combining several security policies and applying them to anything the enterprise uses in the cloud—regardless of what kind of device is trying to access it, such as unmanaged smartphones, IoT devices, or personal laptops.</p>
							<p>The combination of ZTNA and CASB in today's world provides a well-defined, controlled access across cloud and on-premise deployments.</p>

							<h3> My summary</h3>
							<p>
							Currently, employees work primarily from home or on the road, and businesses rely on cloud-based solutions, making them more vulnerable to cyber-attacks. Even more so because, in the usual scenario, once a hacker has gained access, they have complete control over the network. Because "within" denotes safety and "outside" denotes danger. Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) takes a different approach: no one can be trusted until proven false. It operates by establishing a micro tunnel between an application – or a group of applications – and an end-user device, with a broker in the middle deciding who can and can't access the information based on identification and context. The tunnel, which can only be established up between one user and one application at a time, also stops that user from moving around the network laterally. 
							<p>CASB is a full-featured cloud governance tool that can track and manage which cloud services employees use and how they use them, whether they're connected to the corporate network or not. According to Gartner, despite slowing spending growth across the security industry, corporations increased their CASB spending by 33% in 2020, as the category "has entered the mainstream," with the most significant increase of any information security market. It also works with ZTNA to provide well-defined, controlled access across cloud and on-premises deployments.</p>
							<p>Cook (2022) pointed out that CASB is a great way to reduce the risk of data loss due to a lack of security awareness on the part of employees. CASB solutions can also assist organizations in identifying information on the cloud that they are unaware of due to shadow IT, which has been the source of cyber breaches in one out of every five businesses. Also, she stated one of the drawbacks of CASB could be "alert fatigue" due to the constant triggers, making it difficult to distinguish between alerts that require investigation, resulting in a massive overhead for an organization during implementation and after it is delivered.</p>
							<p>Paintsil (2022) observed that while ZTNA is a robust system, it requires proper credentials to access resources in the network. Okafor-Tolofari (2022) further supported the opinion and mentioned that MFA is one of the core features needed for the success of ZTNA. </p>
