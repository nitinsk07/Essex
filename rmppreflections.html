							<h3> Unit 1</h3>
             						 <p>The first unit of the last module! I was excited to get started. However, after the first seminar and understanding, the extent of activities to get done through this module was quite daunting. The first unit started with Collaborative Learning Discussion 1. We had to discuss applying the code of conduct of ACM and BCS to the listed case studies. </p>
							<h3> Unit 2</h3>
							<p>Continuation of collaborative discussions. I had to provide peer responses. The discussions were engaging, and I got to see the viewpoints of my fellow classmates. I also started looking ahead to selecting topics for the literature review and research project. </p>
							<h3> Unit 3</h3>
							<p>I had started to feel lost starting this week. I was able to complete the CLQ and provide a summary. However, since I couldn’t yet finalize a literature review topic and juggling work, life and studies had started to weigh on me. By the end of the week, I finally decided on a topic that I felt best suited to my current portfolio. Cyberbullying. I got a lot of help from my wife (a lecturer), and her advice on how to approach the literature review and research proposal eased my mind.</p>
							<h3> Unit 4</h3>
							<p>This unit focused on research methods such as case studies, focus groups and quantitative and qualitative observations. This week we also have to submit the literature review outline. </p>
							<h3> Unit 5</h3>
							<p>I got feedback from the tutor regarding my literature review outline.  I tried to cover all the factors related to cyberbullying, and I soon realised that it is challenging to analyze deeply and condense them into 2,000 words. </p>
							<p>We also learned about interviews and surveys in this unit. This week's lecture emphasized the necessity of anonymizing the source of information, obtaining informed consent when administering questionnaires, and ensuring that data protection measures are implemented because the data is ultimately owned by the respondents, not the researchers. I also learned the benefits and drawbacks of approaches such as face-to-face interviews and remote questionnaires and when to utilize them from the lecture cast.</p>
							<h3> Unit 6</h3>
							<p>This unit focused on questionnaires and surveys. Barrett's (2020) seven deadly survey questions are one of the unit's primary takeaways: the leading question, the assumptive question, the pushy question, the confusing question, the random question, the double-barreled question, and the ambiguous question.This was quite interesting, and I also read up about it further. There was also a Wiki activity to complete. </p>
							<p>This week was also about getting the literature review completed. </p>
							<h3> Unit 7</h3>
							<p>First summative submission! The literature review has given me a comprehensive understanding of cyberbullying and its effects and helped me understand the complexities of how to avoid it from happening.  It made me think further about the implications and the lack of research around it. Most of the research was from Malaysia. This could be an interesting topic to delve further into. </p>
							<p>This week also started our second Collaborative Learning Discussion, which was about the ethical conflicts of a researcher.</p>
							<h3> Unit 8</h3>
							<p>This week we had to submit our research proposal outline. I selected Active Cyber Defense for Airports as my topic because I am passionate about it. Most of the research surrounding OT networks is on Power grids and manufacturing, and I found it interesting that Aviation networks didn’t feature much in this research. Since I had started planning earlier, the outline was straightforward to prepare.</p>
							<p>This week also focused on statistics. I find statistics very puzzling, and I felt the activity would be difficult to complete. However, the step-by-step instructions in the examples helped me understand statistics and completing the exercise was uncomplicated. </p>
							<h3> Unit 9</h3>
							<p>I received the feedback for the research proposal outline, and it was positive feedback. It reinforced my idea to pursue this topic for my final dissertation. I also discussed this idea with my colleagues and my leadership team, and they were quite keen on it. I started preparing the presentation for submission next week. </p>
							<p>This week continued the statistics from last week. This was a bit more complicated, but I managed to get through. The examples, like last week, helped a lot to get around the worksheets. </p>
							<p>I also posted the summary of the collaborative discussion this week. Overall, I believe this was the busiest week so far. </p>
							<h3> Unit 10</h3>
							<p>The second summative submission is around the corner, and I worked on the Research Proposal Presentation. I had a similar presentation in The Human Factor module and knew how to record my screen, voice and presentation using OBS Studio. Also, the design ideas from PowerPoint made it easy to get a very attractive presentation done quickly. My first recording lasted 16 minutes, and I had to condense the presentation and complete it in the 15 minutes allowed. Overall, I felt quite positive after the presentation.</p>
							<h3> Unit 11</h3>
							<p>Now that the research proposal is done, I feel quite relieved. This week is mostly about preparing for the final e-Portfolio, the final summative. Honestly, I have been a bit sporadic in updating the e-portfolio, so there is quite a bit to be done. But I have already collected the artefacts required, so it should be straightforward. </p>
							<h3> Unit 12</h3>
							<p>Having attended a PMP course at work, I found this module quite familiar. We have used Agile Methodology for our development project during the Secure Software Development module.  For the quiz, I scored 6 out of eight initially. However, these mistakes are needed for further learning. I also got feedback from our tutor for the research presentation, and those are points I will consider when preparing for the final dissertation. </p>
