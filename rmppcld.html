							<h3> My Post</h3>
							<br
							<p>Blocker Plus is an Internet Content filter built on the U.S. Childrenâ€™s Internet Protection Act (CIPA) guidelines (ACM,2022). Blocker Plus uses machine learning to ensure the centrally controlled blacklist is updated with the latest content that may be deemed harmful to minors maintaining principles of the ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct 1.1 and 2.3 (ACM,2022) also BCS Code of Conduct (BCS,2015).</p>
							<p>While reviewing recent complaints of content being blocked incorrectly, the development team found that several activist groups have infiltrated the feedback mechanism that feeds into machine learning. Content related to gay and lesbian marriage, vaccination, climate change and other topics not covered by CIPA was blocked (ACM,2022). </p>
							<p>The machine learning model caused harm by suppressing legitimate public interest topics and violated ACM principles 1.2 and 1.4 (ACM,2022) and the BCS code of conduct 1.C (BCS,2015), which also constitutes discrimination based on sexual orientation (ACM,2022). Furthermore, Blocker plus did not provide sufficient information to stakeholders and the public regarding the issue, which violated ACM principles 1.3, 2.4 and 2.7 (ACM 2022) and the BCS code of conduct 3.D and 3.E (BCS,2015). The decision of Blocker Plus to include a machine learning model was challenging as it violated principle 2.5 of ACM, which mandates that due care is required when deploying machine learning techniques (ACM,2022). </p>
							<p>Content filtering for children is tricky. One approach is to have parents and children create rules collaboratively, which follows a simple process of an application being present on the device and parent and child determining together if it is appropriate. (Hashish, Bunt and Young, 2014).</p>
