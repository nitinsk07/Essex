							<h3> My Post</h3>
							<br>
							<p>Blocker Plus is an Internet Content filter built on the U.S. Children’s Internet Protection Act (CIPA) guidelines (ACM,2022). Blocker Plus uses machine learning to ensure the centrally controlled blacklist is updated with the latest content that may be deemed harmful to minors maintaining principles of the ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct 1.1 and 2.3 (ACM,2022) also BCS Code of Conduct (BCS,2015).</p>
							<p>While reviewing recent complaints of content being blocked incorrectly, the development team found that several activist groups have infiltrated the feedback mechanism that feeds into machine learning. Content related to gay and lesbian marriage, vaccination, climate change and other topics not covered by CIPA was blocked (ACM,2022). </p>
							<p>The machine learning model caused harm by suppressing legitimate public interest topics and violated ACM principles 1.2 and 1.4 (ACM,2022) and the BCS code of conduct 1.C (BCS,2015), which also constitutes discrimination based on sexual orientation (ACM,2022). Furthermore, Blocker plus did not provide sufficient information to stakeholders and the public regarding the issue, which violated ACM principles 1.3, 2.4 and 2.7 (ACM 2022) and the BCS code of conduct 3.D and 3.E (BCS,2015). The decision of Blocker Plus to include a machine learning model was challenging as it violated principle 2.5 of ACM, which mandates that due care is required when deploying machine learning techniques (ACM,2022). </p>
							<p>Content filtering for children is tricky. One approach is to have parents and children create rules collaboratively, which follows a simple process of an application being present on the device and parent and child determining together if it is appropriate. (Hashish, Bunt and Young, 2014).</p>

							<h3> My Summary</h3>
							<br>
							<p>The U.S. Congress passed the Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA) in 2000 in response to worries that kids could obtain inappropriate or harmful content online. Blocker Plus is an internet content filtering software compliant with the mandates of CIPA and ACM codes 1.1 and 2.3 (ACM Ethics, 2018) and BCS Code of Conduct (CoC) 1.a. and 2.d. (BCS, 2015).</p>
							<p>Blocker Plus switched to using machine learning techniques instead, using feedback from home and library users as training data to automatically identify inappropriate content and solve the problem of continual deny list updates. Although the machine learning model originally worked well, its filtering deteriorated and started to obstruct information that was not required by CIPA, such as information about homosexual marriage, climate change, and vaccinations (ACM, 2018). The machine learning model was tainted by activist organizations' abuse of the feedback mechanism to generate unbiased data (ACM, 2022). Before releasing the machine learning function, Blocker Plus failed to thoroughly investigate and design to prevent intentional exploitation by unauthorized hostile users in violation of ACM Codes 2.5, 2.8, and 2.9, or BCS CoC 3.a. and 3.b.</p>
							<p>Angelides (2022) pointed out Blocker Plus also violated UK Equality act 2010 (gov.uk, 2015). An ex-employee of Uber has filed a lawsuit against the company in the UK because the company's machine learning face recognition program did not perform adequately for individuals of color (Booth, 2021). The corporation may still be held accountable for aiding a discrimination crime even though the Blocker Plus algorithm may not have been discriminatory in normal circumstances, especially given that it seems like the hacking knowledge has been kept a secret for some time.</p>
							<p>Ahmad (2022) mentioned that artificial intelligence filters frequently circumvent legal checks and balances, obstructing supervision and obscuring crucial value trade-offs and decisions (Elkin-Koren, 2020, pp.1). The results of automated filtering are corrected by human assessment, which also offers essential feedback for future performance improvement. Therefore, human evaluations should be included in addition to the machine learning method for content moderation to prevent the incorrect removal of useful content.</p>

							<h3> My Post</h3>
							<br>
							<p>Abi works as an institutional researcher and statistics programmer. A manufacturer has assigned Abi a project to evaluate the nutritional worth of a new cereal called Whizzz. After collecting the essential data, he needs to run the relevant analyses and print the reports to send to the manufacturer. Unfortunately, the information Abi has gathered undermines the notion that Whizzz is nutritious and may even show that Whizzz is harmful.</p>
							<p>One of the hallmarks of good research is reproducibility—the ability of independent researchers to produce the same (or similar) results when repeating an experiment or test. Researchers can use reproducibility to demonstrate that their research findings are objective and trustworthy rather than the result of bias or chance (Resnik and Shamoo, 2016). In this case, Abi’s research findings should be reproducible for them to be reliable. Unfortunately, the scope does not cater for multiple independent researchers.</p>
							<p>Abi should publish both the positive and negative results. Although the project comes from the manufacturer, Abi must deliver accurate and unbiased results to maintain institutional integrity in conflict of interest (Pimple, 2002). He has no control over how the manufacturer would use his analysis. If only the positive is published, Abi should contact the local food safety authority and express his concerns. </p>
							<p>According to the UK Research Integrity Office Code of Practice for Research, researchers should aim to foresee any risks that the proposed research will create results that can be utilized for illegal or harmful purposes. Researchers should communicate any concerns to the relevant person(s) in their organization and seek assistance from them, as well as take measures to reduce those risks (ukrio.org, n.d.).</p>

							<h3> My Summary</h3>
							<br>
							<p>Abi is a researcher at an institute and also a statistical programmer. Abi has received a project from a manufacturer to review the nutritional value of a new cereal, Whizzz. Having collected the necessary data, he now needs to perform the appropriate analyses and print the reports to send to the manufacturer. Unfortunately, the data Abi has collected refutes the claim that Whizzz is nutritious and may indicate that Whizzz is harmful.</p>
							<p>My initial post discussed reproducibility being one of the benchmarks of good research. The ability of independent researchers to reproduce the same or similar results when repeating the experiment/analysis would make Abi’s results more reliable (Resnik and Shamoo, 2016). I also pointed out that Abi should publish both positive and negative results to maintain institutional integrity in cases of conflict of interest (Pimple, 2002).</p>
							<p>Mohamed Danialou opined that the reviewer must be capable of analyzing the data and reaching the same conclusion as Abi. If an agreement cannot be reached, the data and the entire outcome are defective and thus untrustworthy. Although peer review is desirable, it is not a cure-all for all data integrity challenges.</p>
							<p>Kei You Yvone Chan pointed out in Abi's case because his institution may benefit financially from the manufacturer, the institution may not take this conflict-of-interest issue seriously, depending on the organization culture.</p>
